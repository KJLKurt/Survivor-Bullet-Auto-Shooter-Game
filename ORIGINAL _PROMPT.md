Can you create a prompt that will work for Claude code and codex (so I can compare the two) making a personal web app (for mobile device with local storage but keep the storage as an abstraction so I can replace it with an API server later) Survivors bullet hell game.  I want the graphics to be basic colors so I can replace them later.  Solid colors are fine for now but I want to replace them later with sprites.

Make it so the personal web app can work offline and when it is connected, if there is an update it will show a notification asking to update.

Please create it in vanilla JS but you can include package.json for any dependencies and have a build step but I want the builds and test to be fast so I can iterate faster.

I want levels and high score.  As I play more I want different things to become available (maybe additional levels to weapons and more weapons).

As I keep playing some sort of coin currency can be collected during game play to the. Purchased new starting characters or different levels (each starting character, weapons, and level will have different stats on abilities).

Make sure to make it as detailed as possible and have 10 different people (each have a different starting weapon and stats), and 10-15 different items that can be upgraded (come up with ideas for each of these) and 3 different levels.

I would like some simple sfx I can easily replace.

Currency will be in-game only.  Have weapons have a cool down and all the other normal stats (some items can be boosts to the players stats, like make them slightly faster or heal slowly)

Please make it clean, testable, and easy to update and extend.  Have it create a readme and a test plan.

Please ask me any questions you may have before providing my output.  If you don't have any questions just provide the output.
